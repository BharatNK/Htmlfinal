                <pre>We're talkin' away
            I don't know what I'm to say
            I'll say it anyway
            Today's another day to find you
            Shying away
            I'll be comin' for your love, okay?
            
            [Chorus]
            Take on me (Take on me)
            Take me on (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two
            
            [Verse 2]
            So, needless to say
            I'm odds and ends
            But I'll be stumbling away
            Slowly learnin' that life is okay
            Say after me
            "It's no better to be safe than sorry"
            
            [Chorus]
            Take on me (Take on me)
            Take me on (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two</pre>
